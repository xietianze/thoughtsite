# Inspiration #

Thoughtsite is envisioned as a social network where potential developers/entrepreneurs can find inspiration to build new applications and businesses. The website is a medium for people to propose and exchange new and interesting business ideas as well as a social network for registered users to search, comment and collaborate on ideas.


# Distribution #

Thoughtsite is still evolving and we're presently working on providing Maven support to the project build process. However, we have temporarily uploaded the required jars to the lib/ directory that can be directly imported into an Eclipse project as external libraries.
